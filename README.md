# Vite React TypeScript Starter

This project is a starter template for building React applications using Vite and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:

- Start the Vite development server.
- Serve your app locally at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
- Enable hot module replacement for an efficient development experience.

### Commands

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run preview`: Previews the production build locally.

### Vite Development Server

When the development server is running:

- Local access: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- Network access: Use `--host` to expose the server on your local network.
- Help: Press `h` and hit enter in the terminal to display available commands.
